## Nsite-Upload

This repo is setup to be a small starter for deploying a static site as a Nsite using the Nsite-CLI.
In general this repo is setup to auto deploy using Github action but also can be used with the CLI to deploy from the terminal.

This is build on top of the work of some great folks: [Lez](https://github.com/lez) [flox1an](https://github.com/flox1an) [hzrd149](https://github.com/hzrd149)

### 1.5) FAQ & Debugging  

#### **Q: My Deployment Failed**  
You might not have set any Blossom servers for your **BUD-03 List**.  
1. Visit [Nsite Debug](https://nsite.info/debug), enter your `npub`, and check for missing configurations.  
2. Set your Blossom Server List via [Bouquet](https://bouquet.slidestr.net).  

Alternatively, try deploying locally:  
1. Download the repo to your local machine.  
2. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en).  
3. Set your `Nsec` in `.nsite/project.json`. *(Modify other settings if needed)*  
4. Run in the terminal from the root directory:  

   ```sh
   npx nsite-cli upload www
   ```  

#### **Q: My Changes Are Not Visible**  
- **Nsite.lol has caching**, so updates may not appear immediately.  
- **Try Nsite.cloud**, which does not have caching and should reflect updates immediately. *(Note: Nsite.cloud only supports simple single-page HTML sites.)*  
- **The Blossom server might not serve the blob via public access.**
